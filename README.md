# Hangman
 
This is a very bad example of programming, but I added it here to show that everyone starts somewhere. 

To run this program, all you do is compile the single (and only) .java file in the src folder and run it. There are three files: figure.txt, hangman.txt, and hangmandefault.txt. 

The figure.txt file is used to illustrate the current 'man' (in the console or terminal).
The hangman.txt and hangmandefault.txt are used for word genetation. The default is what the program defaults to if there are no words. You can toggle whether the words are read chronologically or randomly by changing the first line.

Like I said, I would not write the program in a single file if I were to do it again... looking at this code makes me squinch.
